# MissileCommand

A 2D game heavily inspired by the classic 1980 game of the same name.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command

Created as part of a group project with Timothy White and Stephen
Brown.

## Installation

The game was created using the processing environment, which runs on Java
but requires the installation of the Processing IDE. 
Instructions for installation can be found at
https://processing.org/download

Once installed, simply open the directory inside the Processing IDE and run the
MissileCommand.pde file.

## Reading the code
The code is Java, with each .pde basically being a class file. 
MissileCommand.pde contains the game's main draw loop, and
instantiates all other classes. 

## Music and graphics
The game includes original music written by Benjamin Burton. 
We also created all of the graphics.

## Demo
A demo video of gameplay is available at
